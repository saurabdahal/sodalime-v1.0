These are the problems with my project
1) when i click Open folder under file menu it pops up JFileChooser to select folder 
  and it displays Tree system of that folder in Scrollpane in left side of TabbedPane.
  Problem is there is a panel inside Scrollpane and it's layout is set to gridlayout 
  and whenever i add two folders gridlayout distributes the height of scrollpane between panels
  of these folders so one folder shows up on topn and another one in middle.
  How to make it display folders in the ways it it displayed in all Editors ?

2) when i write a document and save it with a name without extension i want it to add ".txt" (for now)
   to the file, i.e rename the file from "userInput" to "userInput.txt". but it's not happening.
   Code is on FileAction.java under the method FileSaveAction(Tab ta);
